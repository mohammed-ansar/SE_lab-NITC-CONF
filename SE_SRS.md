**Performance Requirements** 

The search and retrieval functionalities in the NITCONF  depend on the timely updates made to the system. The system must promptly respond to user requests, allowing them to efficiently search for and submit papers in a matter of seconds. During peak submission periods, the system should handle a high volume of paper submissions to ensure a smooth and satisfactory user experience. Furthermore, the system should efficiently process abstract submissions and reservations while maintaining reliable and responsive performance. Overall, the performance of the system will be optimized for speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction. 

**Safety and Security Requirements** 

All data within the NITCONF S must be securely stored in a protected database to safeguard sensitive information, including paper submissions and reviewer feedback. While users interact with the system to submit papers, view reviews, and make decisions, robust access controls will be implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel, such as Program Committee members, can modify or make decisions on papers. This stringent access control mechanism helps prevent unauthorized changes, preserving the integrity of the system's records and fostering confidence 

among users in the reliability and security of the NITCONF service..
